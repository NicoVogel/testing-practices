      If you ever heard about TDD, then you most probably have heard these statements.
      The general idea of TDD is great, as that you always have confidence and
      that you test your tests.

      But how do you get started with TDD?

  section
    h2 Process of TDD
    ol
      li Come up with a scenario that you want to test
      li Write a suitable test for it (Red)
      li Implement it (Green)
      li make your code look nice (Refactor)
    aside(class="notes").
      While this sounds rather simple at first, I noticed that it was rather difficult
      to get started.

      li You test your tests
      li You end up with a cleaner implementation

  section
    h3 Cleaner implementation?
    p.
      Because you start with the test, you automatically make the interface
      cleaner and simpler to test.
